## Testing

If you would like to help test the modpack, you're very welcome to do so.
The best way you can test is by playing the modpack, reporting bugs and providing feedback from your experience.

There are a few things we would like testers to consider/look for:

-   Bugs
-   Things you find boring/tedious
-   Things that need small optimizations, such as quest text and textures.
